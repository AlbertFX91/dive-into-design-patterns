# Patterns classification
- **Creational patterns**: deals with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or in added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation, increasing flexibility and reusing of existing code
- **Structural patterns**: eases the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships among entities, explaining how assemble and connect objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexibles and efficient.
- **Behavioral patterns**: identifies common communication patterns among objects. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out communication.

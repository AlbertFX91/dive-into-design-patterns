# Patterns classification
- **Creational patterns**: deals with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or in added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation, increasing flexibility and reusing of existing code
- **Structural patterns**: eases the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships among entities, explaining how assemble and connect objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexibles and efficient.
- **Behavioral patterns**: identifies common communication patterns among objects. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out communication. 

## Creational patterns
### Factory method
Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created

- Use the Factory Method when you donâ€™t know beforehand the exact types and dependencies of the objects your code should work with.
- Use the Factory Method when you want to provide users of your library or framework with a way to extend its internal components (extend a UI element and override the createUI method)
- Use the Factory Method when you want to provide users of your library or framework with a way to extend its internal components. (on createConnection, check if a connection is not being used and provide it as a pool)
